Human eyes perceive orange when observing light with a dominant wavelength between roughly 585 and 620 nanometres. In painting and traditional colour theory, it is a secondary colour of pigments, created by mixing yellow and red. It is named after the fruit of the same name.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><header id="header2" >BLUE</header><p>Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting and traditional colour theory, as well as in the RGB colour model. It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><header id="header3">GREEN</header><p>Green is the color between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495â€“570 nm. In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens.</p></div>
